# Birthday Wish — Client

A lightweight client application for creating and sending personalized birthday wishes. This repository contains the front-end (client) for the Birthday Wish project — a simple, shareable web UI to create animated cards, schedule or send wishes, and share them via link or social media.

> Note: This README is written generically for a typical modern front-end client. If your project uses a specific framework (React, Vue, Svelte, plain HTML/CSS/JS), adapt the "Getting started" and "Environment" sections to match your stack and scripts.

Tech stack
- Front-end: (e.g. React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML/CSS/JS) — replace with your actual framework

- Build tools: Node.js, npm / yarn / pnpm
- Optional: API server to persist or send wishes

Getting started

Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 14 (recommended latest LTS)
- npm (bundled with Node) or yarn / pnpm
- A modern browser for development

Install
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Jignesh1236/Birthday-wish-.git
2. Change into the project directory:
   cd Birthday-wish-
3. Install dependencies:
   - Using npm:
     npm install
   - Or using yarn:
     yarn install
   - Or using pnpm:
     pnpm install

Run (development)
- Using npm:
  npm run dev
  or
  npm start
- Using yarn:
  yarn dev
  or
  yarn start

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or the port shown in the console).

Build (production)
- Create an optimized production build:
  npm run build
  or
  yarn build

- Serve the build locally for testing (example with serve):
  npm install -g serve
  serve -s build

Environment variables
If your client needs to talk to an API or use third‑party services, create a .env file in the project root and add variables used by your app. Example (adjust keys and names to your project):

REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key_here
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com

Important: Do not commit secrets to the repository. Add .env to .gitignore.

Project structure
A typical front-end structure (adapt to your project):
- public/ — static assets, index.html
- src/
  - assets/ — images, fonts, icons
  - components/ — reusable UI components
  - pages/ — page-level components
  - styles/ — global styles and variables
  - utils/ — helpers
  - App.(js|vue|svelte) — application root
  - main.(js|ts) — entry point
- package.json — scripts and dependencies
- README.md — project documentation

Usage
- Open the app in the browser.
- Choose a card template or theme.
- Enter the recipient name and your message.
- Add optional image/GIF and adjust fonts/colors.
- Save or generate a shareable link for the wish.
- (If integrated) schedule or send using backend endpoints.

Customization
- Add new templates: put template files in src/templates and add a selector in the UI.
- Change styling: edit the files under src/styles or update your Tailwind/SCSS config.
- Localize: add translations (i18n) to support multiple languages.
- Add analytics: integrate Google Analytics, Plausible, or another tracker as needed.

Deployment
Popular options:
- Vercel: connect the GitHub repo, select the correct framework preset, and deploy.
- Netlify: drag & drop the build folder or connect the repo and set the build command.
- GitHub Pages: for static builds, push the generated build to the gh-pages branch.
- Docker: create a Dockerfile that serves the build via nginx for containerized deployments.
